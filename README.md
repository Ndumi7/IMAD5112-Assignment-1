An "enjoy your meal message displayed" after a suggestion is made.
A bunch of emojis to A bunch of emojis to enhance the user experience and make it visually appealing.

2. Hardcoded Meal Data
For simplicity and as a beginner project, the meal suggestions are hardcoded into the app. This avoids the complexity of database integration at this stage.

3. Case-Sensitive Input Reminder
The app includes a case-sensitive input reminder for any user inputs that require a specific case format (such as button text). This ensures that users provide inputs correctly and receive accurate suggestions.
4. Reset and Confirm Buttons
A reset button allows users to clear the current meal suggestion, providing a fresh start for another suggestion.
The confirm button lets users approve the meal suggestion, adding an extra layer of interactivity.
